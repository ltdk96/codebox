CodeBox - The Code Execution Engine of ThinkCode.VN
=========
**DISCLOSURE** - The repo of ThinkCode.VN is currently owned by [BMAG R&D Lab][1], so I have no rights to publish it here. However, due to various reasons, the Lab decided to completely rewrite CodeBox based on [this paper of mine][2]; this repo is free to be shared.

---

**Project ThinkCode** (ThinkCode.VN) was a website that teaches programming using programming challenges instead of trivial fill-in-the-blank exercises. It had 2 major features:
1. Allows users to execute code right from the browser, made possible by **CodeBox** (this repo) in the back-end.
2. Allows users to pair program with the instructors, made possible by https://firepad.io/ in the front-end.

These features helped beginners to focus on essential programming concepts as designed by the challenges, instead of setting up or unnecessary details.

**Remark**: Please be aware that since this project is **no longer active**, its associated domain - https://thinkcode.vn - is down as well.

## Won Awards
**Project ThinkCode** won the [**3rd Prize in Creative Software** at **Ho Chi Minh City Youth Informatics Contest 2017**][3].

**CodeBox Engine (this repo)** won the **2nd Prize** at **FPT University's Research Conference for Students (2017)**.

## More Details on ThinkCode.VN
The API of ThinkCode.VN was written using **Ruby on Rails** + deployed on **Amazon EC2**. It has many features, including:
1. Code management (upload/download code templates, extract/zip code templates, directory manipulation, etc.)
2. Content creation under a **multi-step, multi-agent** moderating process
3. Upload and quickly serve static assets using Amazon S3 and Cloudfront

While the back-end was entirely designed and developed by me, the front-end was entirely designed and developed by my wonderful teammate, [Nguyen Tran][4].

## More Details on CodeBox (this repo)
CodeBox is a **locally installed** Node.js API that wraps a **Docker-based sandbox** inside to **run untrusted code** on-demand, returning outputs to the local sender.

CodeBox is developed based on **CompileBox** (https://github.com/remoteinterview/compilebox) with many security improvements and one major feature - the ability to execute a **full code project** instead of a single code file. This is valuable to ThinkCode.VN because code challenges often include many template files, and we need to grade users' submissions.

For an overview of the features and how safe CodeBox is in running untrusted code, please kindly refer to [this poster][5]. 

For more details on the implementation of CodeBox, please kindly refer to [this paper][2].
